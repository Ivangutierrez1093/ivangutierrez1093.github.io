## CPSC 120

*  Lab 3
    Lab 3 part 3 was one of my favorites because it lets us interact with the program and I believe this was the first time we would enter anything into the command line to run our program. I also liked the way it was programmed since we had to think about different ways to write it. This was our first lab and was very interesting. 

*  Lab 4
    Lab 4 part 1 was a favorite also since this is when we had to start thinking more about the math working in the program since it was calculating the difference in the days. And it would output the number of days in between. Also, it was easier since we had our partner to help us. 
*  Lab 5
    Lab 5 part 1 was a favorite like the first example because in this part we got to interact with the program to enter how we wanted our sandwich made. It made us use different variables to get the same output. And we got to upgrad our previous lab of this same type.
